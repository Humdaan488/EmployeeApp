Some learning from this project: 

# General information here about creating a REST API using Django and PostgreSQL
    - Django is the frameowork used to create API while PostgreSQL is the relational database used for storage
    - manage.py is a commant line utility that allows us to interact with Django project
    - we create a basic Django Project at start. A project can then have multiple applications
            - django-admin start project <name of the project>
            - python manage.py runserver
            - python manage.py startapp <the name of the app>

# General steps
 1. Any new app you create must be added to project's settings.py file 
 2. Create models of app using classes in Python. Each class is a database table and each field is a database Field 
 3. Connect PostgreSQL we will use for database to Django. Add database to Settings.py
 4. Make migration files for the models (show changes that will be made to database) and push changes to database
 5. serialize models by adding searlize.py into app folder. With serialization of inputs done, time for API
 6. the business logic of writing API goes into views.py code
 7. Include API Urls in url folder in app and then also need to be added toproject urls so project knows how to handle URL requests


To create an app within project, run python manage.py startapp EmployeeApp
- create migration: python manage.py makemigrations EmployeeApp
- once migrations look good, we can migrate our tables to database: python manage.py migrate EmployeeApp
    - now database should be created

# In PostgreSQL: know how to select query and insert data
